    <br>
    My name is Jacob Brooker and I am a second year Bachelor of    Computer Science student at Conestoga College. Previous to enrolling at Conestoga College I was a   Health and Safety Coordinator for a variety of industries including Automotive and Pet Aftercare. 
    <br><br>
    While working full time as a Health and Safety Coordinator, I spent my free time taking online  coding   courses and working on automating processes. It was during this time that I fell in love  with   development and technology. I decided it was time to take my personal career in a new   direction and   went back to school. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of computers I enjoy snowboarding, playing golf, and watching football (go <img src="/assets/img/bills.png" height="30px"> & <img src="/assets/img/browns.png" height="30px">!). 
    <br><br>
    I hope that we get to meet (safely) soon!
